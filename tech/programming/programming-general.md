## Snippets

In imperative programming, the basic method of computation is changing stored values. These are also more mainstream, with more industry adoption. In declarative programming, the basic method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. These are less mainstream, with less industry adoption.

Haskell falls under a flavour of declarative programming where functions occupy the central role; as opposed to procedures or subroutines, like in imperative languages. A function is a binary relation between two sets that associates every element of the first set to exactly one element of the second set.
