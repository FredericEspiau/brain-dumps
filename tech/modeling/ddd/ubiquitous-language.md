# Ubiquitous language

Ubiquitous Language is the practice of building up a common, rigorous language between developers and users. This language should be based on the Domain Model used in the software - hence the need for it to be rigorous, since software doesn't cope well with ambiguity.

Using the ubiquitous language in conversations with domain experts is an important part of testing it, and hence the domain model. He also stresses that the language (and model) should evolve as the team's understanding of the domain grows.

By using the model-based language pervasively and not being satisfied until it flows, we approach a model that is complete and comprehensible, made up of simple elements that combine to express complex ideas.

Domain experts should object to terms or structures that are awkward or inadequate to convey domain understanding; developers should watch for ambiguity or inconsistency that will trip up design.


## Ubiquitous language

How ubiquitous is a "ubiquitous language"? It is only applicable within the boundaries of a model. That is why I use the word "model language" instead of the fancy expression. Something that can only be used within limits is a bit the opposite of "ubiquitous". It emphasises that the language is used by both the technical and non-technical modelers. But the use of that word is not very beneficial for the communication in my experience. We only have to convince the whole team to use a common model with a common model language. This language is only defined and applicable within the (domain) model. Our model is the context for our model language.
